# rand0m / lcdproc
ldcproc and LCDd config files ready to work with Matrix Orbital MX 2 (USB) series and OpenWrt.
Should work with other distros, if so make sure to set "DriverPath" and "Device" first.
If you using OpenWrt and a Matrix Orbital USB device, install "kmod-usb-serial-ftdi" package and also make sure to add USB chipset suport packages.
